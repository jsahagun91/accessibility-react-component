# Accessibility ADA React App Component 

# Deployment

https://accessibility-react-component.vercel.app/


I developed an Accessibility React Component, designed to enhance ADA compliance on restaurant/service websites. Recognizing the critical need for digital accessibility, I undertook a comprehensive research initiative, leveraging resources such as GitHub, YouTube, and ChatGPT. Despite the abundance of tools available, none adequately met the specific requirements for a straightforward, ADA-compliant solution suitable for restaurant websites.
